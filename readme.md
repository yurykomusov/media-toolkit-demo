# Media toolkit app
One-page Vanilla flavoured app for displaying educational resources

## TODO:

* items.html - apply filters by default
* SingeFilterModule - move binding inside
* access filters by URL i.e `/items?discipline=physics&groupby=ageRange`
* items.html and index.html should be one page with two views
* create placeholder for practice view
* update mocks closer to reality (probably 2nd file)
